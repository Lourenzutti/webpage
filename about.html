                I have postponed creating my own website for quite a while now. I have decided to take up to the task
                and just do it.
                As a motivation, since I wanted to learn more about web development for a while now, I will build this
                website from the ground up.
                So be patient!!! This website is a work in progress and it will have a design (quite?) limited by my
                little knowledge of CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for a matter of content, this website will be focused on topics related to data science. I will write
                posts to clarify concepts
                that many of my students get confused about. If a post becomes too long, I might transform it into a
                tutorial. In tutorials
                I will not only be talking about concepts but also walk you through how to do it in Python or R.
                Ideally, the tutorials will have
                some exercises for you as well.
