        <h1> Sampling Distribution </h1>
        <hr>

        <p>
            This year, 2020, there will be a presidential election in the United States.
            Every election year we see a bunch of surveys trying to draw a picture on how people are going to
            vote.
            But how do they make these surveys? Do these polls check how all the people are going to vote?
            According to this <a
                href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/voting/table01.xlsx">table</a>
            from <a href="https://www.census.gov/en.html">US Census Bureau</a> there are approximately
            233.5 million voting-age citizens. It would certainly require a lot of resources, to
            ask all 233.5 millions voting-age American citizens.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make things more complicated, the political scenario changes quite fast. Therefore, time is
            also an issue. Even if you had the resources to ask everyone, many political events that swing
            voters' opinions
            could happen during your survey, and by the time you are finished, your results are already
            outdated.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>So, how can we learn (at least approximately) how voters are going to vote without asking
                every voter?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            A natural answer for this question is: let us ask just a small portion of the voters how they are going to
            vote.
            This approach does provide us with a solution, but also many problems:


        </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><em>How do we choose the voters to answer the survey?</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>How many voters should answer the survey?</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>How do we <em>infer</em> the knowledge obtained from the Sample to the entire population of
                        voters?</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Different group of voters will have different proportion of votes.</em></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p> In this chapter, we are going to focus on points 2 and 3.
            We will discuss points 1 and 2 in more detail later.
            Let's formalize some intuitive concepts.</p>
        <h2>
            Population and parameters
        </h2>

        <div class="box-def">
            <p>Definition: Target Population</p>
            <p>The group of all items/people that we are interested in.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            In general, we are interested in one or more unknown quantities that describe the population, like summary
            quantities.
            These quantities describe something about the entire population (not about specific individuals in the
            population),
            and they are called parameters.
        </p>
        <div class="box-def">
            <p>Definition: Parameter</p>
            <p>A summary quantity of the population that is unknown.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Parameters are unknown, we are trying to learn them because they tell us information about the population.
            Let's see an example:</p>
        <p>
            <span class="example">Example 1.1:</span> In the election example above, the group of all American
            voters is our population.
            Note that the population is not the group of all Americans. It is the group of American
            <em>voters</em>. We are interested in the proportion of voters that will vote for each
            candidate,
            and the proportion of voters that will abstain from voting.
            In this case, we have more than one parameter of interest.
        </p>
        <div class="box-def box-caution">
            <p>Caution</p>
            <p>A common mistake many students make is to mix up a <strong>variable</strong> of interest with a
                <strong>parameter</strong>
                of interest. For example, one might be interested in the <em>average dolphin weight</em>, which is a
                parameter; the average weight is a quantity of the population, not of a single dolphin. What is being
                measured,
                however, is the <em>dolphin weight</em>, which would be the variable of interest.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-def box-exercise">
            <p>Exercise 1.1</p>
            <p>
                Apple buys touchscreen from Samsung. Suppose that Apple only accepts a batch of screens, if
                the average lifespan of the screens in the batch
                is above 24 months. There's a way an accelerated way to check this, but once the screen fails it is
                useless. Obviously, Apple cannot measure
                all the screens in the batch, otherwise there will be nothing left for them to install in their phones.
                In this case, the population is the batch of screens,
                and the variable of interest is the average lifespan of the screens in months.

                In times of Covid-19, the Canadian government started providing some aid to Canadian workers that
                lost their jobs. The provincial
                government of British Columbia (BC) is studying if it should also provide some aid to university
                students. To make the decision,
                BC's government wants to know the average income of university students in the province.

            As discussed before, in many cases we are not able to measure the variable of interest in the entire
            population. In these cases, we draw a sample of the population. Let's define sample.
        </p>


        <h2>
            Sample
        </h2>
        <p>We are going to call <em>sample</em> any subset (sub-group of elements) of the population. What we
            hope for is that this subset
            would represent the population well, but this is not always the case. Even if the population is
            poorly represented by a sub-group of
            elements, such sub-group is still called a sample of the population.
        </p>
        <div class="box-def">
            <p>Sample</p>
            <p>A subset of the population.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            It is like when you are cooking. Imagine you're making a soup and want to know if the soup has
            enough
            salt. Then, we usually just
            taste a spoon of the soup (a sample), and if that portion that you tasted is lacking salt, you
            conclude that
            the whole soup is lacking salt (inference - from the sample to the population). But imagine you're
            cooking
            a less waterly thing, say, french fries. Then, you take one piece to see if you have
            put enough salt.
            But, just by chance, you ended with a piece that got too much salt on top of it, and you conclude
            wrongly
            that the whole basket of french fries is salty. In this case, you got a sample that doesn't
            represent the
            population well. But again, it's still a sample.
        </p>

        <p>There are many different strategies to draw a sample.
            One of the most common strategy is called <em>random sampling without replacement</em>.
            To take a random sampling without replacement of size <em>n</em> elements from a population you must:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>List all the elements of the population.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Select one element at random from the population (all elements must have the same
                    probability of being selected).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Save the selected element and remove it from the population.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Repeat Steps 2. and 3. <em>n</em> times.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Although random sampling without replacement is one of the simplest way to draw a sample,
            it is still quite effective. However, in some cases it is not the best
            strategy you could use. But let's not worry about this now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have the concept of sample, we can revisit the concept of population.
            As it was mentioned, a sample is a subset of the population. But frequently
            the population that the sample is drawn from is not the same population we are interested
            in. Let us see an example.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="example">Example 2.1:</span>
            In times of Covid-19, the Canadian government started providing some aid to Canadian workers that
            lost their jobs. The provincial government of British Columbia (BC) is studying if it should also
            provide some aid to university students. To make the decision, BC's government wants to know the
            average income of university students in the province. There are many universities in BC, and
            sampling students from all universities can be costly and time-consuming.
            The government decides to sample students only from the University of British Columbia (UBC).
            By doing this, the sample that the government will
            be taking, comes from the population of all UBC students, which is a more restricted group than the
            group of all university students in BC.
        </p>

        <div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;">
            <img width="100%" src="../../../images/STAT200/sampled_population.png"
                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:450px;">
        </div>

        <p>Example 2.1 shows us that we need to improve our definition of population and make a distinction between
            the two populations.</p>

        <div class="box-def">
            <p>Sampled Population</p>
            <p>The group of all items/people which we are taking a sample from.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Ideally, the <em>Sampled Population</em> will coincide with the <em>Target Population</em>. If not,
            be aware that the results based on the sample can only be extrapolated (by means of statistical
            inference) to the Sampled Population. To extrapolate from the Sampled Population to the Target Population
            you
            need a justification beyond statistical inference -- which could be valid, but could be misleading and
            wrong. Careful!
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also worth mentioning that in some cases the target population and sample population differ for
            reasons other than by convenience. This is very common in medical research (see the exercise below).

                Say that a Canadian pharmaceutical company created a drug for a new disease. But now,
                they need
                to test if the drug works on human beings. The company will administer the drug and a placebo
                on some people infected by the disease who are located Canada and compare the results to see if the drug
                works.

                        administer the drug. This is clearly not reasonable. We cannot allow a company to
                        go out there infecting people with a disease to see if a treatment works.
                        This is an example where ethical issues do not allow us to match the sample population with the
                        target

        <p>Great! We now know some of the basic concepts we need.
            Let's review the big picture.</p>

        <h2>Revisiting the Big Picture</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>We are interested in a specific quantity (parameter) of a given population of objects/people. For
                    example,
                    the average income of all UBC students.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;">
                    <img width="75%" src="../../../images/STAT200/population_students.png"
                        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:450px;">
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Due to limited resources we cannot survey the whole population to obtain the exact value of the
                    parameter;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We then take a sample at random from the population.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;">
                    <img width="100%" src="../../../images/STAT200/population_sample.png"
                        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:600px;">
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next, we use the sample to learn about the parameter of the population. For example, if we are
                    interested
                    in the average income of a given population, we calculate the average income in the sample.
                    The value you obtain is called <strong>estimate</strong> of the parameter.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;">
                    <img width="100%" src="../../../images/STAT200/population_estimate.png"
                        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:600px;">
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p> Great, we are done! But wait a second, the sample is random. The fact that we are using Chen, Mary, and
            Amy's average income it is
            just by chance. It could have been Ronald, Mary, and Lien, or Jean, Wang, and Adebola, or
            any three other UBC students. Different samples would give different results. </p>

        <div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;">
            <img width="100%" src="../../../images/STAT200/population_multi_sample.png" style="margin-left: auto; 
                                    margin-right: auto; 
                                    margin-top:10px; 
                                    margin-bottom:10px; 
                                    max-width:600px;">
        </div>
        <p>You might even end up with a sample that is not representative of the population. For example,
            imagine you select three unemployed students. The average income in your sample would be
            smaller than the average income of all UBC's students, since not all UBC's students are
            unemployed.
        </p>
        <p><em>How can we rely on this approach if every time we take a sample we get a different estimate</em>?</p>

        <p>Admittedly, since the estimate is a random value, we will not hit the mark and get an estimate that exactly
            matches the value of the parameter of interest. However, we don't need to. We just need to obtain an
            estimate that is <em>"close enough most of the time"</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Sampling distribution
        </h2>

        <p>When try to learn about an unknown parameter, taking a sample and getting an estimate is a very reasonable
            approach. However, different samples will provide different estimates bringing uncertainty to the results.
            Think about, without knowing the population, how can you know that the sample you got represents well the
            population and will yield a good estimate for the parameter?
        </p>

        <p>
            In an attempt of understanding better the variation of the estimates caused by random sampling, we could
            the value we would obtain in each and all possible samples of a given size. For example, considering all
            possible samples of 3 UBC students, how many samples provides a sample average income between C$ 0.00 and C$
            50.00, between C$ 50.00 and C$ 100.00, and so on? In other words, we could consider the sample mean of all
            possible samples, and study its distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="example">Example 3.1:</span> Suppose we want to know how many hours per week the employees of a

            The table above contains all of our population. Now, suppose we want to estimate the average weekly hours of
            work of
            the restaurant's employees using a sample of size 3. How would the sample mean would vary in this population
            across different
            samples of size 3? There are 1140 different possible samples of size 3 that we could take, as shown in the
            table below.

        <h5> Population: </h5>

        <p>
            So, how many voters should we ask (sample size)?
            But how is this possible? Also, what do I mean by approximately?
            We see that some of these polls are accurate and others are quite wrong. We will see that even the
            surveys with bad results are bounded to occur occasionally, and this is anticipated.
            Which brings us another question: what do I mean by occasionally? How frequent is that?
            Some of these surveys are quite accurate, others not so much.

            Bookkeeping:
        <ul>
            <li>What should be our sample size?</li>
            <li>What do we mean by approximately?</li>
            <li>What do we mean by occasionaly?</li>
        </ul>

        Statistical inference is the area of statistics that is focused on the extrapolation of results
        observed in a sample of the population to the whole population. It helps us to answer the questions
        above by measuring the intrinsic uncertainty and errors caused by the use of a sample of
        items/people instead of the whole population. One of the core concepts of statistical inference is
        <emph>Sampling Distributions</emph>, which will discuss in this post.
        But first, let's discuss what is a population and what is a sample more precisely.
