        <h1>Sampling Distribution</h1>

        <p>
            In 2020, there was a presidential election in the United States.
            Every election year, we see many surveys trying to draw a picture of how people will vote. But how do they
            do these surveys? Do these polls check how all the people are going to vote?
            According to this <a
                href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/voting/table01.xlsx">table</a> from <a
                href="https://www.census.gov/en.html">US Census Bureau</a> there are approximately 233.5 million
            voting-age citizens. It would certainly require a lot of resources to ask all 233.5 million voting-age
            American citizens (in fact, this is what the election period is for, right? and we all know how complicated
            and expensive is organizing the election).
        </p>

        <p>
            To make things more complicated, the political scenario changes quite fast. Therefore, time is also an
            issue. Even if you had the resources to ask everyone, many political events that swing voters' opinions
            could happen during your survey, and by the time you are finished, your results are already outdated.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>So, how can we learn (at least approximately) how voters are going to vote without asking every
                voter?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            A natural answer for this question is: let us ask just a small portion of the voters how they are going to
            vote. This approach does provide us with a solution, but also many problems:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><em>How do we choose the voters to answer the survey?</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>How many voters should answer the survey?</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>How do we <em>infer</em> the knowledge obtained from the Sample to the entire population of
                        voters?</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Different group of voters will have different proportion of votes.</em></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p> In this chapter, we are going to focus on points 3 and 4.
            We will discuss points 1 and 2 in more detail later.
            Let's formalize some intuitive concepts.</p>
        <h2>
            Population and parameters
        </h2>

        <div class="box-def">
            <p>Target Population</p>
            <p>The group of all items/people that we are interested in.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            In general, we are interested in one or more unknown summary quantities that describe the entire population
            (as opposed to specific individuals in the population), and they are called parameters.
        </p>
        <div class="box-def">
            <p>Parameter</p>
            <p>A summary quantity of the population that is unknown.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Parameters are unknown, we are trying to learn them because they tell us information about the population.
            Let's see an example:</p>
        <p>
            <span class="example"></span> In the election example above, the group of all American voters is
            our population.
            Note that the population is not the group of all Americans. It is the group of all American <em>voters</em>.
            We are interested in the proportion of voters that will vote for each candidate, and the proportion of
            voters that will abstain from voting. In this case, we have more than one parameter of interest.
        </p>
        <div class="box-def box-caution">
            <p>Caution</p>
            <p>A common mistake many students make is to mix up a <strong>variable</strong> of interest with a
                <strong>parameter</strong> of interest. For example, one might be interested in the <em>average dolphin
                    weight</em>, which is a parameter; the average weight is a quantity of the population, not of a
                single dolphin. However, the <em>dolphin weight</em> is what is being measured, i.e., the variable of
                interest.
            </p>

                Apple buys touchscreens from Samsung. Suppose that Apple only accepts a batch of screens if the screens'
                average lifespan in the batch is above 24 months. Naturally, Apple cannot test all the screens in the
                batch; otherwise, there will be nothing left for them to install on their phones.

                In times of Covid-19, the Canadian government started providing some aid to Canadian workers that lost
                their jobs. The provincial government of British Columbia (BC) is studying if it should also provide
                assistance to university students. To make the decision, BC's government wants to know the average

            In general, the population distribution is unknown because we cannot measure the variable of interest over
            the entire population. In these cases, we draw a sample from the population to learn about the population
            distribution.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Sample
        </h2>
        <p>We are going to call <em>sample</em> any subset (sub-group of elements) of the population. What we hope for
            is that this subset would represent the population well, but this is not always the case. Even if the
            population is poorly represented by a sub-group of elements, such sub-group is still called a sample of the
            population.
        </p>
        <div class="box-def">
            <p>Sample</p>

            It is like when you are cooking. Imagine you're making a soup and want to know if the soup has enough salt.
            Then, we usually just taste a spoon of the soup (a sample). If that portion that you tasted lacks salt, you
            conclude that the whole soup lacks salt. This process is the so-called inference; you are extrapolating
            results from a sample to the entire population. Now imagine you're cooking less waterly food, say, french
            fries. Then, you take one piece to see if you have put enough salt. But, just by chance, you ended with a
            piece that got too much salt on top of it, and you conclude wrongly that the whole basket of french fries is
            salty. In this case, you got a sample that doesn't represent the population well. But again, it's still a
            sample.

        <p>There are many different strategies to draw a sample.
            One of the most common strategy is called <em>random sampling without replacement</em>.
            To take a random sampling without replacement of size <em>n</em> elements from a population you must:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>List all the elements of the population.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Select one element at random from the population (all elements must have the same
                    probability of being selected).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Save the selected element and remove it from the population.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Repeat Steps 2. and 3. <em>n</em> times.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Although random sampling without replacement is one of the simplest ways to draw a sample, it is still quite
            effective. However, in some cases, it is not the best strategy you could use. But let's not worry about this
            now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that you know the concept of <em>sample</em>, we need to revisit the concept of population. As it was
            mentioned, a sample is a subset of the population. But frequently the population that the sample is drawn
            from is not the same population we are interested in. Let us see an example.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="example"></span>
            In times of Covid-19, the Canadian government started providing some aid to Canadian workers that lost their
            jobs. The provincial government of British Columbia (BC) is studying if it should also provide some aid to
            university students. To make the decision, BC's government wants to know the average income of university
            students in the province. There are many universities in BC, and sampling students from all universities can
            be costly and time-consuming.
            The government decides to sample students only from the University of British Columbia (UBC).
            By doing this, the sample that the government will be taking, comes from the population of all UBC students,
            which is a more restricted group than the group of all university students in BC.
        </p>

        <div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;">
            <img width="100%" src="../../imgs/sampling-distribution-sample-mean/sampled_population.png"
                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:450px;">
        </div>

        <p>Example 2.1 shows us that we need to improve our definition of population and make a distinction between the
            two populations.</p>

        <div class="box-def">
            <p>Sampled Population</p>
            <p>The group of all items/people which we are taking a sample from.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Ideally, the <em>Sampled Population</em> will coincide with the <em>Target Population</em>. If not, be aware
            that the sample results can only be extrapolated (by means of statistical inference) to the Sampled
            Population. To extrapolate from the Sampled Population to the Target Population, you need a justification
            beyond statistical inference -- which could be valid but could be misleading and wrong. Careful!
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also worth mentioning that in some cases the target population and sample population differ for
            reasons other than convenience. This is very common in medical research (see the exercise below).

                Say that a Canadian pharmaceutical company created a drug for a new disease. But now, they need to test
                if the drug works on human beings. The company will administer the drug and a placebo on some people
                infected by the disease who are located Canada and compare the results to see if the drug works.

                        administer the drug. This is clearly not reasonable. We cannot allow a company to go out there
                        infecting people with a disease to see if a treatment works! In this case, ethical issues
                        prevent us from matching the sample population with the target population.

                    <img width="100%" src="../../imgs/sampling-distribution-sample-mean/population_sample.png"
                        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:600px;">
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Next, we use the sample to learn about the parameter of the population. For example, if we are
                    interested in the average income of a given population, we calculate the average income in the
                    sample.
                    The function/formula you are using is called <strong>estimator</strong> (e.g., sample mean, sample
                    variance,
                    sample quantile) and the value you obtain in a given sample is called <strong>estimate</strong> of
                    the parameter.
                </p>

                <div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;">
                    <img width="100%" src="../../imgs/sampling-distribution-sample-mean/population_estimate.png"
                        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:600px;">
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>


        <p>
            Great, we are done! But wait for a second; the sample is random. The fact that we are using Chen, Mary, and
            Amy's average income is just due chance. It could have been Ronald, Mary, and Lien, or Jean, Wang, and
            Adebola, or any other three UBC students. Different samples would give different results.
        </p>

        <div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;">
            <img width="100%" src="../../imgs/sampling-distribution-sample-mean/population_multi_sample.png" style="margin-left: auto; 
                                    margin-right: auto; 
                                    margin-top:10px; 
                                    margin-bottom:10px; 
                                    max-width:600px;">
        </div>
        <p>
            You might even end up with a sample that is not representative of the population. For example,
            imagine you select three unemployed students. The average income in your sample would be
            smaller than the average income of all UBC's students, since not all UBC's students are
            unemployed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>How can we rely on an approach if every time we take a sample, we get a different estimate</em>?
        </p>

        <p>
            Admittedly, since the estimate is a random value, the chances are that we will not hit the mark and get an
            estimate that exactly matches the value of the parameter of interest. However, we don't need to. We just
            need to obtain an estimate that is <em>"close enough most of the time"</em>.
        </p>

        <!--------------------------------
            SECTION SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION
        ---------------------------------->

        <h2>
            Sampling distribution
        </h2>

        <p>When trying to learn about an unknown parameter, taking a sample and getting an estimate is a very reasonable
            approach. However, different samples will provide different estimates bringing uncertainty to the results.
            Think about, without knowing the population, how can you know that the sample you got represents the
            population well and will yield a good estimate for the parameter?
        </p>

        <p>
            To better understand the variation of the estimates caused by sampling variation, we could obtain the sample
            mean for each one of the possible samples of a given size. For example, considering all possible samples of
            3 UBC students, how many samples provide a sample average income between C$00.00 and C$50.00, between
            C$50.00 and C$100.00, and so on? In other words, we could consider the sample mean of all possible samples
            and study its distribution.
        </p>

            The table above contains the entire population (i.e., all the 20 fish in the aquarium). Now, suppose we want
            to
            estimate the average Weight (dkg) of the fish using a random sample of size 3. How would the sample mean
            vary across different samples of size 3? There are 1140 different possible samples of size 3 that we could
            take,
            as shown in the table below.

                    <dt>Say that BC's government is also interested on the inequality of students' income. What would be
                        the populational parameter in this case?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The variance (or standard deviation) of BC's university students.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>True or False: Each time we take a random sample we will have a different sampling distribution.

                    <dd>
                        False!!! This can be confusing. But note that the sampling distribution is using the table of
                        all possible samples.
                        We are not concerned about the result in one sample only, but in all of them.

        <p>As you can see, the sampling distribution tells us a lot about our statistic. We could, for example,
            calculate the probability that our statistic would be to a certain range around the parameter. But, how is
            this useful if we need to have access to all possible samples? In fact, if we had access to all possible
            samples, we would be better off just checking out the entire population. In our very small example above, we
            have 20 elements in the population but 1140 possible samples of size 3. Luckily for us, we do not need to
            have access to all possible samples to know the sampling distribution. We don't even need to know much about
            the population itself. This is so awesome that I will say it again: we are able to approximate the sampling
            distribution of a statistic even without having access to the population! All we need is a sample! The same
            sample that you use to calculate the statistic will also give you information on the uncertainty of your
            estimate.

            </form>
            <button class="btn-show-answers">Show answers</button>
            <div class="solution">
                <dl>
                    <dt> Population distribution</dt>
                    <dd>True! The population distribution will certainly affect the sampling distribution. For example,
                        if you
                        have more variability in the population, you will most probably have more variability in the
                        estimates as well. </dd>

                    <dt> Sample distribution</dt>
                    <dd>
                        False! The sample distribution changes according to the sample obtained, and consequently the
                        estimate.
                        But the sampling distribution is not about one sample, it is about all possible samples.
                    </dd>
                    <dt> Sample size </dt>
                    <dd>
                        As we increase the sample size, the estimator tends to vary less from sample to sample, which
                        would make
                        its sampling distribution narrower.
                    </dd>
                    <dt> Estimator </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The sampling distribution is the distribution of a given estimator. If you change the estimator,
                        you are
                        also changing the sampling distribution. For example, imagine you that you want to estimate the
                        weight of the lightest
                        fish in the aquarium. So, instead of the sample mean, you would calculate the sample minimum.
                        The values in the table shown in Example
                        4.1 would be completely different, and consequently, so would be the sampling distribution.

                </dl>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Next, we will discuss two ways to approximate the sampling distribution from a single sample: (1)
            Bootstrapping; and (2) the Central Limit Theorem. </p>
