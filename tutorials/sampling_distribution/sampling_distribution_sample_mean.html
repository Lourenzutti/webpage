                    This year, 2020, there will be a presidential election in the United States.
                    Every election year we see a bunch of surveys trying to draw a picture on how people are going to
                    vote.
                    But how do they make these surveys? Do these polls check how all the people are going to vote?
                    According to this <a
                        href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/voting/table01.xlsx">table </a>
                    from <a href="https://www.census.gov/en.html">US Census Bureau</a> there are approximately
                    233.5 million voting-age citizens. It would certainly require a lot of resources, to
                    ask all 233.5 millions voting-age American citizens.
                </p>

                    To make things more complicated, the political scenario changes quite fast. Therefore, time is
                    also an issue. Even if you had the resources to ask everyone, many political events that swing
                    voters' opinions
                    could happen during your survey, and by the time you are finished, your results are already
                    outdated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>So, how can we learn (at least approximately) how voters are going to vote without asking
                        every voter?</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We could ask just a small portion of the voters, how they are going to vote.

                    Before we dive into how this works, let's formalize some intuitive concepts.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    1. Population and parameters
                </h3>
                <p>
                    By population we mean the group of all items/people that we are interested in. In general,
                    we are interest in one or more parameters of the population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A parameter is a quantity of the population that we are interested in.​ It describes
                    something about the population. The parameters are usually unknown. We are trying to learn about
                    them.
                    Let's see a few examples:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em><strong>Example 1.1:</strong></em> In the election example above, the group of all American
                    voters is our population.
                    Note that the population is not the group of all Americans. It is the group of American
                    <em>voters</em>. We are interested in the proportion of voters that will vote for each
                    candidate,
                    and the proportion of voters that will abstain from voting.
                    In this case, we have more than one parameter of interest.
                </p>
                
                <h5>
                    Exercise 1.1
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Apple buys touchscreen from Samsung. Suppose that Apple only accepts a batch of screens, if
                    the average lifespan of the screens in the batch
                    is above 24 months. There's a way an accelerated way to check this, but once the screen fails it is
                    useless. Obviously, Apple cannot measure
                    all the screens in the batch, otherwise there will be nothing left for them to install in their phones. 
                    In this case, the population is the batch of screens,
                    and the variable of interest is the average lifespan of the screens in months.

                        The variance (or standard deviation) of the lifespan of the screens could be used to capture such
                        information.

                    In times of Covid-19, the Canadian government started providing some aid to Canadian workers that
                    lost their jobs. The provincial
                    government of British Columbia (BC) is studying if it should also provide some aid to university
                    students. To make the decision,
                    BC's government wants to know the average income of university students in the province.

                <p>
                    As discussed before, in many cases we are not able to measure the variable of interest in the entire
                    population. In these cases, we draw a sample of the population. Let's define sample.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    2. Sample
                </h3>
                <p>We are going to call <em>sample</em> any subset (sub-group of elements) of the population. What we
                    hope for is that this subset
                    would represent the population well, but this is not always the case. Even if the population is
                    poorly represented by a sub-group of
                    elements, such sub-group is still called a sample of the population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is like when you are cooking. Imagine you're making a soup and want to know if the soup has
                    enough
                    salt. Then, we usually just
                    taste a spoon of the soup (a sample), and if that portion that you tasted is lacking salt, you
                    conclude that
                    the whole soup is lacking salt (inference - from the sample to the population). But imagine you're
                    cooking
                    a less waterly thing, say, french fries. Then, you take one french fries to see if you have 
                    put enough salt.
                    But, just by chance, you ended with a piece that got too much salt on top of it, and you conclude
                    wrongly
                    that the whole basket of french fries is salty. In this case, you got a sample that doesn't
                    represent the
                    population well. But again, it's still a sample.
                </p>

                <p>There are many different strategies to draw a sample.
                    One of the most important is called <em>random sampling</em> (or sampling with
                    replacement).
                    To take a random sample of <em>n</em> elements from a population you must:
                    <ol>
                        <li> List all the elements of the population.</li>
                        <li> Select one element at random from the population. All elements must have the same
                            probability of being selected.</li>
                        <li> Save the selected element and put it back in the population.</li>
                        <li> Repeat Steps 2. and 3. <em>n</em> times.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Random sampling is very mathematically convenient. However, in many cases it is not the best
                    strategy you could use. But let's not worry about this now.

                <p>
                    Now that we have the concept of sample, we can revisit the concept of population.
                    As it was mentioned, a sample is a subset of the population. But frequently
                    the population that the sample is drawn from is not the same population we are interested
                    in. Let me try to give an example.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em><strong>Example 2.1:</strong></em>
                    In times of Covid-19, the Canadian government started providing some aid to Canadian workers that
                    lost their jobs. The provincial government of British Columbia (BC) is studying if it should also
                    provide some aid to university students. To make the decision, BC's government wants to know the
                    average income of university students in the province. There are many universities in BC, and
                    sampling students from all universities can be costly and time-consuming.
                    The government decides to sample students only of the biggest university in the province,
                    which is the University of British Columbia (UBC). By doing this the sample that the government will
                    be taking, comes from the population of all UBC students, which is a more restricted group than the
                    group of all university students in BC.
                </p>

                Example 2.1 shows us that we need to improve our definition of population and make a distinction between
                the two populations.

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Target Population:</strong> The group of all items/people we are interested in.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Sampled Population:</strong> The group of all items/people that we actually taking
                            our sample from.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Ideally, the <em>Sampled Population</em> will coincide with the <em>Target Population</em>. If not,
                    be aware that your results based on the sample can only be extrapolated (by means of statistical
                    inference)
                    to the Sampled Population. To extrapolate from the Sample Population to the Targe Population you
                    need a
                    justification beyond statistical inference -- which might be valid, but might also be misleading and
                    wrong.
                    Careful!
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is also worht mentioning that sometimes the target population and sample population differ for
                    reasons other than by choice. This is very common in medical research (see the exercise below).

                    Say that a Canadian pharmaceutical company created a drug for a new disease, say Covid-19. But now,
                    they need
                    to test if the drug works on human beings. The company will administer the drug and a placebo
                    on some people infected by Covid-19 who are located Canada and compare the results to see if the drug works.

                    <p>
                        The company would need to infect the whole world population, which is clearly not reasonable.
                        Besides, the company would need to be able to administer the drug/placebo on people anywhere in the World (not just Canada).
                        These are examples logistics and ethical problems when trying to match the target population with the sampled
                        population, which makes it impossible.

                    So, how many voters should we ask (sample size)?
                    But how is this possible? Also, what do I mean by approximately?
                    We see that some of these pools are accurate and others are quite wrong. We will see that even the
                    surveys with bad results are bounded to occur occasionally, and this is anticipated.
                    Which brings us another question: what do I mean by occasionally? How frequent is that?
                    Some of these surveys are quite accurate, others not so much.

                    Bookkeeping:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What should be our sample size?</li>
                        <li>What do we mean by approximately?</li>
                        <li>What do we mean by occasionaly?</li>

                    Statistical inference is the area of statistics that is focused on the extrapolation of results
                    observed in a sample of the population to the whole population. It helps us to answer the questions
                    above by measuring the intrinsic uncertainty and errors caused by the use of a sample of
                    items/people instead of the whole population. One of the core concepts of statistical inference is
                    <emph>Sampling Distributions</emph>, which will discuss in this post.
                    But first, let's discuss what is a population and what is a sample more precisely.
