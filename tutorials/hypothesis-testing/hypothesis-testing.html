        <h1>Hypothesis Testing</h1>

        <p>So far, we have focused on the problem of estimation. We have a population of interest, and we are interested
            in the specific value of an unknown parameter of this population (e.g., the population mean, median,
            quantiles, standard deviation). However, oftentimes we are not interested in the value of the parameter per
            se, but we are just interested in whether a certain statement about the population is true.</p>

        <p><span class="example"></span> During the summer, Vancouver's beaches get pretty busy. To ensure everybody's
            safety, the city of Vancouver monitors if the beaches' waters are safe for swimming. To test the water
            quality of a beach, the city of Vancouver takes multiple samples of the water and calculates the average
            number of E. coli (a bacteria) per \(100\)mL. If the average number of E. coli per \(100\)mL is less than
            \(400\), the city considers the beach proper for swimming. Otherwise, the city of Vancouver releases a
            warning to let people know that they should not swim on the beach. In this case, the actual precise number
            of E. coli per \(100\)mL is of less interest. Instead, the focus is to determine whether the water is safe,
            i.e., if the number of E. coli per \(100\)mL is less than \(400\).</p>

        <p>We have two possible scenarios in this case: (1) the water is <strong>unsafe</strong> for swimming; or (2)
            the water is <strong>safe</strong> for swimming. </p>

            average? In this case, we are comparing two populations: males and females. But our main interest is not
            obtaining an accurate estimate of the difference in average speed between the populations. Instead, it is to
            check if there is a difference at all (large or small). We have two possible scenarios, either the men and
            women run at the same average speed, or they don't.</p>

                not
                to determine precisely the
                increase in the chances of survival caused by the treatment. Instead, we just want to check if there's

                helps. We have two possible scenarios, either the treatment helps or doesn't.</p>

            <!--<p>It is important noting that, although hypothesis testing is not about estimating the parameters of interest, it closely related to that, as we will see later the close relation between hypothesis tests and confidence interval.</p>-->
            <h2>Statistical Hypotheses</h2>
            <p>Generally, in hypothesis testing, we have two possible scenarios (no more, no less). Note that the
                scenarios refer to the population, and each scenario is called a hypothesis.</p>

            <div class="box-def">
                <p>Statistical Hypothesis</p>
                <p>A statistical hypothesis is a statement about the population distribution(s).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Note that Definition 1.1 does not specify what kind of statement we are making about the population
                distribution. It can be a statement about the functional form of the distribution, such as the
                population distribution is symmetric; or the population is normally distributed. But it can be more
                specific, a statement about a population parameter, such as the population mean is higher than 10; the
                population variance is equal to 1; the mean between two populations is equal.
                Here we will focus on the second case, and our hypothesis will be about population parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we always have exactly two scenarios in classical statistical hypothesis testing, we have exactly
                two hypotheses. They are commonly referred to as the <strong>Null Hypothesis</strong> (denoted by \(H_0\))
                and the <strong>Alternative Hypothesis</strong> (denoted by \(H_A\) or \(H_1\)). The <em>null
                    hypothesis</em> refers to the status quo; it is the hypothesis of no change. The <em>alternative
                    hypothesis</em> is usually the hypothesis that something has changed; something interesting
                happened. In practice, you can think of the <em>null hypothesis</em> as the hypothesis that we will
                reject if and only if there is "strong enough evidence" against it. If we still have "reasonable doubt"
                that \(H_0\) could be true, we will not reject it. For this reason, we say that the <em>null
                    hypothesis</em> is the status quo. The <em>alternative</em> hypothesis, on the other hand, is the
                complement of the null hypothesis, and it is true if and only if \(H_0\) is false. Again, there is no
                other possible scenario besides the null and alternative hypotheses.
            </p>

            <p><span class="example"></span>
                The city of Vancouver considers the beaches safe for swimming if the water has fewer than 400 E. Coli
                bacterias per 100mL of water. So, the City of Vancouver wants to test whether the average number of E.
                Coli per 100mL, \(\mu\), is less than 400.
                $$\left\{
                \begin{align}
                H_0: & \quad \mu \geq 400\\
                H_1: & \quad \mu \lt 400 \end{align}\right.$$
                Note that, by setting the hypothesis this way, the city's default behaviour is to release a warning about
                the safety of the water, unless there is "strong" evidence that the water is safe to swimming.
                Alternatively, the
                city of Vancouver could take the instance that all beaches are safe for swimming, unless there is
                "strong" evidence
                otherwise. In this case, the hypotheses would be:
                $$\left\{
                \begin{align}
                H_0: & \quad \mu \leq 400\\
                H_1: & \quad \mu \gt 400 \end{align}\right.$$
                Remember, \(H_0\) is the status quo hypothesis, the default conclusion if the evidence is not "strong"
                enough.
            </p>

            <div class="end-part"></div>

            <p><span class="example"></span> Do men run faster than women, on average? In this case, we are
                comparing
                two populations: males and females. Unless there is "strong" evidence that men run faster than
                women,
                we are going to assume they do not. What we want to test in this case is if both populations
                have the
                same average. In other words,
                $$\left\{

                H_1: & \quad\text{the new drug works}
                \end{align}\right.$$
                But wait for a second, we said that a statistical hypothesis is a statement about population
                distribution(s).
                What are the population(s) in this case? What are \(H_0\) and \(H_1\) referring to? In this
                case,
                we have two abstract populations: (1) the population of all sick patients who would potentially
                receive
                the drug; and (2) the population of all sick patients who would potentially not receive the
                drug. Finally, how can we say that the drug works? That will depend on how we measure its
                efficacy. One
                could for example, see if the mortality rate of patients who received the drug, \(p_2\) is
                significantly
                lower  (we'll discuss what this means soon) than the mortality rate of patients who did not
                receive the
                drug,
                \(p_1\). Then, the hypotheses would be:
                $$\left\{
                \begin{align}
                H_0: & \quad p_1 = p_2\\
                H_1: & \quad p_1 > p_2
                \end{align}\right.$$

                Or, if the drug is to treat pain, one could check the pain of
                patients before and after they take the drug. Then, we check if average pain after the patients
                take the
                drug, \(\mu_1\), lower than before they take the drug, \(\mu_2\). In this case, we would have:
                $$\left\{
                \begin{align}
                H_0: & \quad \mu_1 = \mu_2\\
                H_1: & \quad \mu_1 > \mu_2
                \end{align}\right.$$
                Note, however, that concluding if a drug is effective is not just a matter of comparing two
                populations.
                One needs to carefully design the experiment from which the data will be collected
                so that a causal conclusion that patients improved because of the drug, and not for any other
                hidden reason, can be made.

            <h3>Hypotheses and the parametric space</h3>

            <p>As we have seen earlier, the two hypotheses in a hypothesis test must cover all possible scenarios without having anything in common. This means that one and only one of the hypotheses is true. 
                Now, suppose we are interested in the median of a population. What are the possible values for this parameter? In general, the median can be any number, positive, negative, or zero. In some cases, however, we can restrict the possible values of the median because we have extra information about the problem. For example, the variable of interest is the red blood cell count in 1 microliter of blood; we already know that the median cannot be negative. Similar reasoning applies to other parameters as well. For example, one might be interested in the population's standard deviation, which is known to be nonnegative. However, one might have some extra information on the problem and can restrict the possible values even more. They could know that the standard deviation is higher than a 10, for example. This notion of what possible values a parameter can take is important to model our uncertainty. </p>

            <div class="box-def">
                <p>Parametric Space</p>
                <p>The parametric space of a parameter \(\theta\) is the set of all possible values that \(\theta\) can take. </p>
            </div>
            <p style="text-indent: 0;">Note that \(\theta\) is just a symbol commonly used to refer to an arbitrary parameter (which could be mean, or median, or a quantile, or the std. deviation, or anything really). When we are testing a parameter of a population distribution, the hypotheses split the parametric space into two subsets that share no values in common and together contain all values in the parametric space.</p>

            <p><span class="example"></span>
                In Example 1.1, the city of Vancouver wanted to conduct the following hypothesis test:
                $$\left\{
                    \begin{align}
                    H_0: & \quad \mu \geq 400\\
                    H_1: & \quad \mu \lt 400 \end{align}\right.$$
                
                    This means that, for the city of Vancouver, the average count of E. Coli bacteria in 100mL of water can be anything less than 400, could be  400, or anything above 400. Therefore, these hypotheses together form a parametric space that contains any number. In other words, the city of Vancouver is not restricting the parametric space based on any other information.  Naturally, in this case, \(\mu\) cannot be negative since it is the average number of E. Coli in 100mL of water. So, we could say that the parametric space here is any nonnegative number (we could technically represent this by making \(H_1: \ \  0\leq\mu\leq 400\), but doing so is quite unusual). 
            </p>
            <p>A much more common way to set up the hypotheses in introduction to statistics books is:
                $$\left\{
                    \begin{align}
                    H_0: & \quad \mu = 400\\
                    H_1: & \quad \mu \lt 400 \end{align}\right.$$
            In this case, the combined hypotheses form a parametric space that contains any value between 0 (inclusive) and 400 (inclusive). This setup is used even if we are not sure that the mean \(\mu\) could not be higher than 400. The reason for using equality instead of \(\geq\) is that it simplifies the problem and, in most practical cases, does not affect the analysis. I'll make another comment on this later on.</p>
